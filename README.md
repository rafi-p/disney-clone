# React + Vite

This project is a frontend exploration of creating a beautiful and responsive UI inspired by the Disney Plus website. It provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules. There is no backend or server attached to this project.

## Description

The project uses two official plugins:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md): This plugin uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh. Fast Refresh is a React feature that allows you to get instant feedback for changes in your React components.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc): This plugin uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh. SWC is a super-fast JavaScript/TypeScript compiler.

## Installation

To install the project, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. Then, you can clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
npm install
