# Disney Clone

This project is a frontend exploration aiming to replicate the user interface and experience of the Disney Plus website using React and Vite. It provides a minimal setup to kickstart your development journey with React and Vite, offering a responsive and visually appealing UI reminiscent of the popular streaming service.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to delve into frontend development using modern tools and frameworks, specifically React and Vite, while simultaneously studying the design patterns and UI elements employed by Disney Plus. By cloning the Disney Plus interface, I am aiming to gain insights into building intuitive and engaging user interfaces while mastering frontend development practices.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The UI adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, ensuring optimal viewing experience across devices.
- **Fast Refresh**: Leveraging the power of [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) and [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc), the project implements Fast Refresh, enabling instant feedback for changes in React components.
- **Minimal Setup**: With a minimal configuration, this project provides a quick setup to get started with React development in Vite, eliminating the need for complex setup procedures.

## Installation

To install the project, ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
